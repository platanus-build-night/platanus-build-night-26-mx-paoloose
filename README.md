## ⚠️ Deploying (Vercel, Render, etc.)

Deploy platforms like **Vercel**, **Render** or **Netlify** can only connect to
repositories **you own** — they can't be granted access to this organization repo.
To deploy while keeping your commits here, mirror your code to a personal repo:

1. Create a **personal** repository on your own GitHub account.
2. Point your local `origin` at **both** repos, so a single `git push` updates each one:

   ```bash
   # this org repo (keep it as a push target)...
   git remote set-url --add --push origin https://github.com/platanus-build-night/platanus-build-night-26-mx-paoloose.git
   # ...and your personal repo
   git remote set-url --add --push origin https://github.com/<your-user>/<your-repo>.git
   ```

   From now on `git push` sends every commit to **both** repositories.
3. Connect your deploy service (Vercel, Render, …) to your **personal** repo and deploy from there.

Your commits stay mirrored here for judging, while the deploy runs from the repo you control.

Have fun! 🚀
